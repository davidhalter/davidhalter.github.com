&lt;strong&gt;Settled&lt;/strong&gt; online, so I tried to write them down:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;Well it&amp;#39;s funny with age
you get to the stage
you had in your heart
down on the same page
your heart will wait forever
but your skin says you&amp;#39;re getting old.

Good things come to those who wait
the lights were up and it&amp;#39;s getting late.
She wore my coat cause she said that it was cold.

Funny how quick a coat turns into the ring
Looking back now I don&amp;#39;t remember a thing

Refrain:
------------------------------------------------------
We don&amp;#39;t talk about the writings on the wall
Somedays we don&amp;#39;t talk at all
And when the lights are dim and my time is free

I sometimes think about the good times that I missed
Sometimes think about the girls I could have kissed.
But I set old for her and she set old for me.
------------------------------------------------------

Well it&amp;#39;s funny how time just seems to fly,
you blink your eyes and it will pass you by
For too long you&amp;#39;re getting on the bus for free.
Same old routine, same old blue jeans,
Same old nightmares, different dreams.

Funny how quick the days turn into years,
Funny some people stay, some disapear.

We don&amp;#39;t talk about the writing on the wall...

Ain&amp;#39;t it funny how you miss someone and
you sat there next to them at home
Ain&amp;#39;t it funny how hard we are to change,
like we&amp;#39;re made out of stone.

We don&amp;#39;t talk about the writing on the wall...
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;strong&gt;Manchester&lt;/strong&gt; online, so I tried to write them down:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;Well Manchester you and me we&amp;#39;re free to be whatever we
decide but like the weather we never really know.
It&amp;#39;s time beneath your gray sky singing to my throats dry
And you would never ask why, because we both already know.

Well Manchester you and I are tangled like a fishing line
dangled from your city spire and hanging down below.
I stand beneath your doorways and listen to your stories,
you&amp;#39;re struggeling in more ways than one I suppose.

Oh Manchester take me I&amp;#39;m yours for the ?keeping?
though the rain fills my shoes
from the sky always leaking,
you&amp;#39;re a baby that&amp;#39;s laughing,
you&amp;#39;re a widow that&amp;#39;s weeping,
and I feel your heart beating tonight.

Well Manchester me and you we&amp;#39;re aging you know it&amp;#39;s true,
with each passing year or two our shadows grow long
the lines on my face are like the cracks in this place
but you&amp;#39;ll still be standing long after I&amp;#39;m gone.

So Manchester take me I&amp;#39;m yours...

Oh Manchester take me I&amp;#39;ll never stop asking
though your answer is silent it is honest and lasting.
There&amp;#39;s a beauty that&amp;#39;s here
And it&amp;#39;s never caught ?buskin?
and I feel your heart beating tonight.
I feel your heart beating tonight.
I feel your heart beating tonight.
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Well, it's no secret that I've been trying to produce music for a while, now.
And it's also no secret that I never really did something that I was content
with. I never even released something :-)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I hope this blog may be a good start. At least there's a platform for me,
now.&lt;/p&gt;
