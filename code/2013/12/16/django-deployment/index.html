      <p>written on Monday, December 16, 2013</p>

  <p>I've recently tried to release a Django application in a small intranet. It was
hell all over again. I'm not very experienced with nginx, uwsgi and gunicorn,
so I always have to read a lot.</p>
<p>The fact is: <strong>Deploying Django in 2013 is hard!</strong> As a guy who writes 2-3
small web apps a year, I don't want to fight with nginx and gunicorn. I just
want to use something like <tt class="docutils literal">deploy test.example.org</tt> in my Django directory.</p>
<p>So I decided to write my own (and yet) little deployment software. If people
like it, I'm willing to invest some of my time. I would be very happy to
receive feedback on how we could create an API that makes deploying simple
things really easy!</p>
<div class="section" id="php-goodness">
<h2>PHP Goodness?!</h2>
<p>Let's face it, PHP is <a class="reference external" href="http://me.veekun.com/blog/2012/04/09/php-a-fractal-of-bad-design/">horrible</a>. But the PHP eco system has always done one
thing fairly well: Deploying is easy. You can argue that Nginx is better than
Apache, but still all the new sexy systems (Django/Rails/Node/Flask) are far
more complicated than <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">apt-get</span> install php5</tt>, if you want to deploy to your
own server.</p>
<p>Now - I don't want (old) PHP deployment back. There's often no easy way of
making a difference between debug and production. People screw up dependencies
and permissions. But let's face it. PHP has something really valuable there for
beginners and &quot;app programmers&quot; that don't like dealing with systems,
especially if they don't like Linux (e.g. <tt class="docutils literal">WAMP</tt> people).</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="solution-travis-ci">
<h2>Solution: Travis-ci?</h2>
<p>Anybody using <a class="reference external" href="https://travis-ci.org">Travis-ci</a>? <strong>Awesome</strong>, right?  It
just solves testing for you. That is how I imagine <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/davidhalter/depl">depl</a> to be. Travis also
does something like a deployment. Your code is completely running on their
servers and can be tested. In comparison to e.g. Heroku (which is also pretty
cool), travis uses a more explicit way to deploy. I like travis way better,
because travis yaml files allow for a more flexibility and complete control. I
also like to know what's going on.</p>
<p>My solution provides defaults for typical use cases. It leaves more complex use
cases to awesome software like <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/ansible/ansible">ansible</a>. If you really need 10 different
databases, custom paths, etc, you shouldn't be using <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/davidhalter/depl">depl</a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="some-deployment-options">
<h2>Some Deployment Options</h2>
<p>There are a variety of tools to deploy, but non of them really fit the simple
use case. I don't want dozens of files just for deploying my very simple Django
project. I want at most one (something like travis). But to give you an
overview:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/ansible/ansible">ansible</a> is awesome for deploying big projects, you could check out <a class="reference external" href="http://www.stavros.io/posts/example-provisioning-and-deployment-ansible/">this</a>
for a Django deployment with ansible.</li>
<li><a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/opscode/chef">chef</a>/<a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/puppetlabs/puppet">puppet</a> do the same thing. But I like <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/ansible/ansible">ansible</a> with its <tt class="docutils literal">.yml</tt> files
better somehow. It's a cleaner approach IMHO.</li>
<li><a class="reference external" href="http://www.docker.io">docker</a> is awesome, but you still have to deploy your software into docker
containers - that's where <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/davidhalter/depl">depl</a> could step in.</li>
<li><a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/mitchellh/vagrant">vagrant</a> is cool(for development), but again - how do you deploy in the first
place. And also I wouldn't trust virtualbox for deploying things.</li>
</ul>
<p>I have analyzed those options and <a class="reference external" href="/code/2013/12/16/paas/">Platform as a Service</a> providers
briefly. I realized that there is nothing to deploy Django easily (in an
in-house setting), so I started creating <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/davidhalter/depl">depl</a>. Not just for Django. For all
the frameworks out there that still struggle with deployment.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="on-a-side-note-similar-ideas-to-depl">
<h2>On a Side Note: Similar ideas to depl</h2>
<p>I've found two projects that are similar to what I imagine a good deploy tool
should be like. The first one is <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/capistrano/capistrano">capistrano</a> for ruby/rails. My problem with
capistrano is that I don't really understand it - but I also don't really
understand the ruby world, so I won't complain here.  Something just smells
bad, because the tool can not be explained in one page.</p>
<p>Quite with the same problems struggles the second tool &quot;<a class="reference external" href="http://gigaom.com/2012/10/11/wercker-aims-to-fix-the-app-dev-universe/">wercker</a>&quot;. It's a
little bit too hard to explain, because it also includes a
testing/deploying/whatever platform. It seems to be a very complete and
complicated model - too complicated for a normal open source developer. Might
be interesting for professionals deploying web applications very often.</p>
<p>However both really haven't inspired me. The only positive inspiration is
travis and the fact that all things should be easy in life. :-)</p>
