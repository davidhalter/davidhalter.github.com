Hi. I'm David Halter. I wish I would still be 23, but that's not the case
anymore. I studied computer science @zhaw.ch. I'm currently intentionally
unemployed as long as this is working out. Also I'm deeply fascinated by the
likes of `Shane Claiborne <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LCdqI-woLRo>`_.
