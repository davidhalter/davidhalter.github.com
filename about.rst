Hi. I'm David Halter. I wish I would still be 23, but that's not the case
anymore. I studied computer science @zhaw.ch. I'm currently working on `open
source <https://github.com/davidhalter>`_ projects, as long as money isn't an
issue. Also I'm deeply fascinated by the likes of `Shane Claiborne
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LCdqI-woLRo>`_.
